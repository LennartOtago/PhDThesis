\chapter{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data sensitive informative uninformative, Ozone in higher altitude, pressure , temperature
	\item SNR v s Pointing accuracy from experience
	\item include pointing accuracy, weighted mean for pointing accuracy
	\item Through exploratory analysis we found that instead of increasing the ranks optimising the tensors by sweeping over them gives better approximations and is faster, which is crucial in higher dimensions as in section \ref{sec:postPT}.
\end{itemize}
