\subsection*{Personal}

I would like to thank Alex Elliott for his wonderful help and support. None of this would be possible otherwise.


\subsection*{Institutional}

If you want to separate out your thanks for funding and institutional support, I don't think there's any rule against it.  Of course, you could also just remove the subsections and do one big traditional acknowledgement section.
