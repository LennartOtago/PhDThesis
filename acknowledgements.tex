I acknowledge my heritage, the society I grew up in and my access to free education.
I feel very privileged. 
Without the support of my parents I would not be where I am
today, Dankesch{\"o}n! 
Danke Mama, Papa, Hinnerk, Jonna, Oma Sigrid und Mel. 
Shout out to all the friends I made along the way and for letting me chew your ear off about
all the issues I encountered.
